## Getting Started
Install dependencies:

```bash
wally install
```

Build the place from scratch:

```bash
rojo build -o "FirstCodexRoblox.rbxlx"
```

Next, open `FirstCodexRoblox.rbxlx` in Roblox Studio and start the Rojo server:

```bash
rojo serve
```

The client bootstrap mounts a React Luau UI into `PlayerGui`.
Server data sessions are managed through `ProfileStore` via `src/server/data/ProfileService.luau`.
